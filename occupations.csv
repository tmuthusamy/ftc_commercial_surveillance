"686","We urge the FTC to use its existing regulatory authority to protect consumers from algorithmic bias, including bias in products where the end user is a government entity."
"687","”2 Accordingly, the FTC should consider how companies like Meta serve consumer preferences—including by encouraging competition on both price and quality—when they engage in the data collection and use practices the ANPR calls “commercial surveillance."
"688","Surveillance advertising incentivizes platforms to favor hate and extremism Tech companies’ fundamental business model—surveillance advertising—maximizes profits because the astronomical amount of data collected on every user enables platforms to target them with the content and recommendations best designed to keep those users engaged on the platform for as long as possible in order to serve them with as many ads as possible."
"689","The problem of commercial surveillance must be seen as one of an unfair imbalance of corporate power and consumer rights."
"690","1 The purpose of these comments is to provide the perspective of the retail industry on the proposal of the Commission to implement new trade regulation rules to govern the ways in which companies collect, use, and disclose consumer data."
"691","5 “How do companies collect consumers’ biometric information? What kinds of biometric information do companies collect? For what purposes do they collect and use it? Are consumers typically aware of that collection and use? What are the benefits and harms of these practices?” 6 “Should the Commissions consider limiting commercial surveillance practices that use or facilitate the use of facial recognition, fingerprinting, or other biometric technologies? If so, how?” 7 “Does the weight that companies give to the outputs of automated decision-making systems overstate their reliability? If so, does that have the potential to lead to greater consumer harm when there are algorithmic errors?” 8 “To what extent, if at all, should new rules forbid or limit the development, design, and use of automated decision-making systems that generate or otherwise facilitate outcomes that violate Section 5 of the FTC Act? Should such rules apply economy-wide or only in some sectors? If the latter, which ones? Should these rules be structured differently depending on the sector? If so, how?” 9 “To what extent should new trade regulation rules prohibit certain specific commercial surveillance practices, irrespective of whether consumers consent to them?” 10 This practice is also called “affect recognition,” “emotion detection,” and “emotion(al) AI."
